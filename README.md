# üéÖ Advent of Code 2023 üéÅ

## Note
I am using AOC23 to learn python. Having never written much Python, and only maybe 10-20 lines ever in production, I'm new to it.
So please, if you see any code that is not pythonic or overly complex, know I'm still learning.

## Organization
Each solution is in a numeric folder named by `Day#`
In each folder will be an `input.txt`, which captures the provided input file
Along with a Python file in the format of `day#_solver.py`
If there are ever multiple solution attempts, the solver number will increment

## Execution
Each Python file is stand-alone and expects the input.txt file to be at the same directory level.
When run, the solution answers will be printed to the console

## Tests
If tests exist, they are pytest and are located in the root folder of all days, organized by `test_day#_solver.py`.
